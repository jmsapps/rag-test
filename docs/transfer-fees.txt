HappyTrade Transfer Fees
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-09-19

SUMMARY
Transfers between HappyTrade accounts are free of charge under normal circumstances. This policy applies to most standard account types, including non-registered accounts, RRSPs, TFSAs, RESPs, and other supported plans.

1) SCOPE OF THIS POLICY
- Applies to: Internal transfers between accounts held under the same HappyTrade customer profile.
- Includes: Cash, equities, mutual funds, ETFs, fixed income, GICs, and other supported securities.
- Excludes: External transfers (to another financial institution) unless explicitly stated otherwise.

2) TYPES OF TRANSFERS COVERED
a) **Cash Transfers**
   - Moving available cash balance from one account to another within the same customer profile.
   - Real-time availability depends on settlement status (T+2 for most securities sales).
b) **In-Kind Transfers**
   - Moving securities as-is (no liquidation).
   - No commission is charged to transfer.
   - Transfer eligibility: Security must be held in both source and destination account types.
c) **Partial vs. Full Transfers**
   - Partial transfers: Only selected assets or cash amounts.
   - Full transfers: Entire account positions; source account may be closed after completion.

3) FEES
- Standard internal transfers: $0.
- Forced liquidation: If a security must be sold because it cannot be held in the destination account, normal trading commissions and potential market impact apply.
- FX conversion: If transferring between CAD and USD sub-accounts, currency conversion fees apply per prevailing FX spread and schedule.
- Paper statement reprints, courier services, or manual interventions may incur separate charges unrelated to the transfer fee.

4) TIMING
- Cash transfers: Typically instant between HappyTrade accounts (during business hours).
- In-kind transfers: May take 1–3 business days depending on asset type and settlement.
- Complex holdings (private placements, certain fixed-income instruments): May require additional processing time.

5) HOW TO INITIATE
- Online Banking: Navigate to “Transfers” → “Between HappyTrade Accounts.”
- Mobile App: Supported via “Transfers” tab with same-day processing.
- Phone or Branch: Client Services can initiate on your behalf (may require identity verification and wet signature for certain accounts).

6) TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS
- Regulatory restrictions: Some securities (e.g., locked-in RRSP funds) cannot be transferred to certain account types.
- Margin accounts: Ensure margin requirements remain satisfied after transfer. You may be required to deposit collateral before transfer approval.
- Frozen accounts: Internal compliance holds must be cleared before transfer is processed.

7) COMMON USE CASES
- Funding TFSA contribution room from non-registered account.
- Moving matured GIC proceeds into RRSP before contribution deadline.
- Consolidating cash from multiple accounts for investment.
- Internal rebalancing: Moving securities to align portfolio risk.

8) EXAMPLES
Example A — TFSA Contribution:
- Transfer $6,500 from non-registered cash account to TFSA.
- Fee: $0. Funds available immediately.

Example B — In-Kind Mutual Fund Transfer:
- Move 50 units of ABC Growth Fund from RESP to Family RESP.
- Fee: $0. Processing 1–2 business days.

Example C — Forced Liquidation:
- Attempt to transfer a security not allowed in destination account (e.g., a restricted share class).
- Result: Position sold at market price; regular commission charged. Proceeds transferred as cash.

Example D — Currency Conversion:
- Transfer $10,000 CAD cash to USD account.
- Fee: $0 transfer fee, but FX spread applies at posted rate.

9) TAX AND REPORTING IMPACT
- Registered accounts: Contributions and withdrawals must respect CRA rules. Internal transfers do not affect contribution room if staying within the same plan type.
- Non-registered accounts: Capital gains are not realized when securities are moved in-kind internally.
- Statements: Both source and destination accounts will show journal entries with matching timestamps.

10) SECURITY AND FRAUD CONTROLS
- 2FA: Transfers initiated online may require multi-factor authentication.
- Suspicious activity monitoring: Large or unusual transfers may trigger additional verification.
- Customer notifications: Confirmation sent by secure message/email after transfer is completed.

11) SUPPORT AND ESCALATION
- Online Help Centre: Provides walkthroughs and FAQs for common transfer scenarios.
- Client Services: Available by phone for troubleshooting, including assistance with rejected transfers.
- Escalations: Complex cases (e.g., estate accounts) are escalated to Back Office Operations.
